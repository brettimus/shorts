# shorts
A client-side, mobile-friendly app for creating short notes.

## Prompt
> Create a mobile web app that allows you create, edit, and view short notes. Notes are just small textual items, like to-do lists.
- Notes should be stored using browser local storage
- The app should be usable on a standard mobile browser

## About the boilerplate
We're making liberal use of some boilerplate I slapped up [here](https://github.com/brettimus/booty-booty-boilerplate).

## Developing
To get going on your own:
- clone this repo
- `npm build` (**note** uses `make`)
- `npm start`

`npm build` calls `make`, which creates a `dist` folder with (you guessed it!) our distribution.

`npm start` kicks off the webpack dev server on port `8899`
